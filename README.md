## User Iteraction Enabled

Target must be UIView subclass and user iteraction enabled is on. You can set it in IB in View section: (example for UILabel)

![user_iteraction_enabled](Resources/user_iteraction_enabled.png)

or in code:

```swift
someView.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
```

## Code usage

Connect object:

```swift
@IBOutlet var hideKeyboardTapGestureManager: HideKeyboardTapGestureManager!
```

or add in code:

```swift
let hideKeyboardTapGestureManager = HideKeyboardTapGestureManager()
```

Add new targets:

```swift
hideKeyboardTapGestureManager.add(targets: [someView1])
```

or remove old ones:

```swift
hideKeyboardTapGestureManager.remove(targets: [someView2])
```

## Xib support

To use with xib you must add strong property to controller:

```swift
@IBOutlet var hideKeyboardTapGestureManager: HideKeyboardTapGestureManager!
```

> Otherwise it will be deinited. It is logic of Objects in xibs.
